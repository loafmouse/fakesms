This is my simple code to send sms with professional number in any country , so it's like small sms spoofer

# Pros
*-> It's super easy to use just run spoof.sh and you are done*\
*-> It's completely free of cost and nothing required like :- api , signup etc..*\
*-> With this tool , You can send sms with just your terminal and internet*

# Cons
*-> You can send only one message to a specific number in every 24 hours (1 day )*\
*-> Not likely , but sometimes it will show that test texting (free texts) is disabled , as server closes it (not often)*

# Usage / Installation

1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrOdball/fakesms/main/spoof.sh
2. bash spoof.sh or sudo ./spoof.sh
3. Done !!

# In progress

*-> Adding new sites soon*\
*-> Temux script coming soon | btwn You can use this script too , if curl is already installed :wink:*\

# Thanks
