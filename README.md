This is my simple code to send sms with professional number in any country , so it's like small sms spoofer

# Pros
1. It's super easy to use just run spoof.sh and you are done
2. It's completely free of cost and nothing required like :- api , signup etc..
3. With this tool , You can send sms with just your terminal and internet

# Cons
1. It doesn't give you the desired phone no.
2. You can send only one message to a specific number in every 24 hours (1 day )
3. Not likely , but sometimes it will show that test texting (free texts) is disabled , as server closes it (not often)


# Usage / Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/MrOdball/fakesms
2. cd fakesms
3. chmod +x spoof.sh (optional)
4. sudo bash spoof.sh or sudo ./spoof.sh


Feel free to open a bug or correct my code , btwn this is my first bash script hope you liked :kissing_closed_eyes:
